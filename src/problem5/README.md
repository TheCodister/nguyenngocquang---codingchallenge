# Currency Swap API

A fast and scalable backend service for handling currency conversions, built with **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma ORM**. This backend provides APIs to fetch real-time conversion rates and manage conversion history.

## üöÄ Features

- RESTful API endpoints for currency conversion
- Stores conversion history in **PostgreSQL** using **Prisma ORM**
- Validates requests with **Zod** for type safety
- Implements **CORS** for frontend integration
- Error handling and logging

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the backend:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** (preferred package manager)
- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org//)** (for storing conversion data)
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)** (ORM for database management)

## ‚ùì Why I Chose These Technologies

- **Node.js:** A powerful, asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime. It is
  essential for running JavaScript-based applications, including both the
  frontend and backend of this project.
- **pnpm:** I prefer **pnpm** over **npm** or **Yarn** because it is faster and
  uses less memory when installing dependencies.
- **SQLite**: Since this is a simple application, SQLite is sufficient for handling basic CRUD operations. For larger projects, I would typically use PostgreSQL.
- **Prisma**: Prisma is a modern and powerful ORM that provides better control over data compared to traditional ORMs. It also enhances developer productivity with its intuitive API and type safety.

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pnpm`:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheCodister/nguyenngocquang---codingchallenge.git
cd src/problem5

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Server

Before starting the server, configure your environment variables in a `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/currency_db
PORT=3001
```

Run database migrations and seed data:

```sh
pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm prisma db seed
```

Start the Express server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The server will run at `http://localhost:3001/`.
